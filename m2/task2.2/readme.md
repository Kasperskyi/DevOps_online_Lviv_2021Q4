# Task 2.2


## 1. Results of task 

I registered an AWS Free Ter account and launched ec2 instances in my own account and in the Amazon Lightsail. I created snapshots for the instances and the new EBS disk. 
I created my repository in the S3 and uploaded files to it.
I also created a new user in IAM. I deployed the docker container to ECS and created a cluster.
In finally, I created an HTML page with my photo and links to completed labs and upload it to the S3 bucket.
