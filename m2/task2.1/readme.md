  - VMware vSphere with ESX/ESXi
  - KVM (Kernel-Based Virtual Machine)

  - Oracle VM
  - Citrix Hypervisor (formerly known as Xen Server)
 
 Hosted hypervisors:

  - Windows Virtual PC
  - Parallels Desktop

## 1.2 The main differences of the most popular hypervisors
| Bare-metal hypervisor | Hosted hypervisors |
| ----------------------| -------------------|
| A bare-metal hypervisor is a layer of software we install directly on top of a physical server and its underlying hardware. | This type of hypervisor runs inside of an operating system of a physical host machine. |
|This type hypervisor is proven in providing excellent performance and stability since it does not run inside Windows or any other operating system. | As opposed to bare-metal hypervisors that run directly on the hardware, hosted hypervisors have one software layer underneath. |
| Better for enterprise environments | Better for personal use and smaller deployments |
| High price | Low price or moneyless  |
| Speed is faster |  Speed is slower |
| High perfomance| Low perfomance |
| More secure | Less secure |


## 2. Results of work with virtulbox

I set up VirtualBox on my laptop and created vm with installed Ubuntu 2104. I reminded posibilities of VirtualBox: cloning vm, creating shapshots and groups, exporting and importing vm. More dificult then in VMware Workstation was adding shared folder. New experiense for me was working with vm trought command line.

See the some screenshots attached.

## 3. Results of work with Vagrant

I worked with Vagrant first time. That is good tool for setup and configure multiple vms. I used all commands proposed in task for creating vms.

See the some screenshots attached.
