  - KVM (Kernel-Based Virtual Machine)
  - Microsoft Hyper-V
  - Oracle VM
  - Citrix Hypervisor (formerly known as Xen Server)
 
 Hosted hypervisors:

  - VMware Workstation Pro/VMware Fusion
  - Windows Virtual PC
  - Parallels Desktop

## 1.2 The main differences of the most popular hypervisors
| Bare-metal hypervisor | Hosted hypervisors |
| ----------------------| -------------------|
| A bare-metal hypervisor is a layer of software we install directly on top of a physical server and its underlying hardware. | This type of hypervisor runs inside of an operating system of a physical host machine. |
|This type hypervisor is proven in providing excellent performance and stability since it does not run inside Windows or any other operating system. | As opposed to bare-metal hypervisors that run directly on the hardware, hosted hypervisors have one software layer underneath. |
| Better for enterprise environments | Better for personal use and smaller deployments |
| High price | Low price or moneyless  |
| Speed is faster |  Speed is slower |
| High perfomance| Low perfomance |
| More secure | Less secure |


## 2. Results of work with virtulbox

I set up VirtualBox on my laptop and created vm with installed Ubuntu 2104. I reminded options of VirtualBox: cloning vm, creating shapshots and groups, exporting and importing vm. basic git commands: clone, init, branch, checkout, add, commit, merge, log, reflog, remote and push.
I created 3 new branches: develop, images and styles and merged them into the main branch with fixing conflict. In the end, I checked logs and pushed all files in Github repository.

See the some screenshots attached.
