# Task 1.1


## 1. Results of task 

I set up Git on my laptop and configured it. In practice I used basic git commands: clone, init, branch, checkout, add, commit, merge, log, reflog, remote and push.
I created 3 new branches: develop, images and styles and merged them into the main branch with fixing conflict. In the end, I checked logs and pushed all files in Github repository.

See the some screenshots attached.
